//console.log(name);

//var name = "vijay";

//replacing var with let and it actually gives error 
//which is required in backend code 

//let name = "vijay";




var name = "vijay";

if(true){
    //var lastName = "Choudhary";
    let lastName = "Choudhary";
   // console.log(lastName);
}

//I am keeping out of if but still it is printing ,it is an issue
//So the solution is ,we should use let 
console.log(lastName);
